# sassy-square-root-function

If you've ever thought to yourself:
"Wow, the default square root function in R sure is boring."
or
"I wish my square root function would sass me when I input a negative number."

I have just the solution.

Introducing "sassy_sqrtfunc.R"!

```sassy_sqrt()``` will not only work as a vanilla square root function but also as a source for "pop culture" reference that will harm your soul! 
This function will sass you until your ego is broken when you act like a cretin and request the square root of a negative number.

Give it a shot
```
sassy_sqrt(100)
sassy_sqrt(1234567)
sassy_sqrt(-10)
sassy_sqrt(-2)
```
